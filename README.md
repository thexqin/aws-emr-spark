# AWS EMR Spark Data Analysis

This repository, `aws-emr-spark`, showcases robust **Python** and **data analysis skills** by leveraging **Apache Spark** on **AWS Elastic MapReduce (EMR)**. It provides a practical example of processing and analyzing large datasets, specifically the IMDB dataset, to extract meaningful insights.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis on a large dataset using **PySpark** on an **AWS EMR cluster**. The analysis focuses on a subset of IMDB's data, including information about actors, genres, movie principals, and movie ratings.

The notebook walks through the following key steps:

* **Setup and Installation**: Installing necessary Python packages (`pandas`, `matplotlib`) on the EMR cluster.
* **Data Loading**: Efficiently loading large `.tsv` datasets from **Amazon S3** into **Spark DataFrames**.
* **Data Inspection**: Displaying schemas, sample data, and row/column counts for each DataFrame.
* **Data Transformation**: Performing operations like dropping columns, filtering, and denormalizing data (e.g., exploding genres).
* **Data Analysis - Movie Genres**:
    * Identifying unique movie genres.
    * Calculating the average rating for each genre.
    * Visualizing genre ratings using horizontal bar charts.
* **Data Analysis - Job Categories**:
    * Identifying unique job categories.
    * Counting the number of titles associated with each job category.
    * Visualizing the top job categories using bar charts.

## Sample Analysis & Capabilities

The provided sample files highlight the analytical capabilities demonstrated in this repository. Here are some key outputs and insights:

### Data Loading and Initial Inspection

Data from S3 is loaded into Spark DataFrames. For instance, the `name` DataFrame, containing information about actors, looks like this:

```
root
 |-- nconst: string (nullable = true)
 |-- primaryName: string (nullable = true)
 |-- birthYear: string (nullable = true)
 |-- deathYear: string (nullable = true)
 |-- primaryProfession: string (nullable = true)
 |-- knownForTitles: string (nullable = true)

## Getting Started

To replicate this analysis, you will need:

* An **AWS account** with permissions to create and manage EMR clusters and S3 buckets.
* The IMDB dataset (or a similar large, tab-separated dataset) uploaded to an **S3 bucket**.
* Familiarity with **PySpark** and **Jupyter notebooks**.

## Usage

1.  **Launch an EMR Cluster**: Configure an EMR cluster with Spark installed.
2.  **Upload Data**: Ensure your IMDB `.tsv` files are accessible from an S3 bucket.
3.  **Run the Notebook**: Execute the provided Jupyter notebook (or adapt the Spark code) on the EMR cluster. The notebook demonstrates the full data loading, transformation, and analysis workflow.
